# CryptChat â€” Demo website

This project is a frontend-first demo of a Privacy-First phishing prevention UI inspired by VirusTotal (upload UX), SonicLamb (scroll-trigger animations), and modern security products.

What you get:
- React + Vite project scaffold
- Tailwind CSS
- GSAP scroll-trigger animations
- Simple 3D background using Three.js + @react-three/fiber
- Scan panel (mocked analysis) + local vote saving
- Assistant chatbox (frontend demo)

How to run:
1. npm install
2. npm run dev

Notes:
- This demo does NOT perform real scanning. Integrate a sandboxed backend and VirusTotal API for production.
- Votes are stored in localStorage in this demo.
